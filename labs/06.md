# Search Examples
Time: 20 minutes

## Instructions
Let's start doing simple searches in Splunk by applying the concepts we've reviewed so far. Instead of just copying and pasting search queries, this time you'll create yours based on the data from the main index (the data that Eventgen is sending).

### Create Simple Searches
Search operators are really important in Splunk, and it's common to use them in almost every search. You'll start practicing with simple operators like `NOT`, `OR`, and `AND` operators we saw in class. So this time, you need to do the following:

- 6.1 - Create a simple search to display events with destinations to NY and MIA
- 6.2 - Same as before, but for AK or LAX
- 6.3 - Same as before, but where the destination is not SEA
- 6.4 - Create a search where you combine different operators
