# Search Examples
Time: 20 minutes

## Instructions
Let's start doing simple searches in Splunk by applying the concepts we've reviewed so far. Instead of just copying and pasting search queries, this time you'll create yours based on the data from the main index (the data that Eventgen is sending).

### Create Simple Searches
Search operators are really important in Splunk, and it's common to use them in almost every search. You'll start practicing with simple operators like `NOT`, `OR`, and `AND` operators we saw in class. So this time, you need to do the following:

Create a simple Search using field operators (hint: explore the data find a field with the needed data points to complete the tasks):

- 6.1 - Display splunk events that are __/booking/reservations__.
- 6.2 - Display splunk events with __destination__ to __NY__ or __MIA__
- 6.3 - Display splunk events that are __destination__ but not to __SEA__
- 6.4 - Display splunk events that have a __status code__ of __404__
